# Introduction

Our research question is: Does wearing sunglasses to limit visible light before bedtime improve sleep quality? We measure sleep quality via wearable activity trackers, such as a smart-watches and smart-rings. Sleep quality itself can be operationalized in various ways. We will be looking specifically at sleep quality as measured by:

1.  Sleep Score: This is a measure from 0-100 calculated by common activity tracker platforms. The formulas are proprietary and can vary across platforms. However, we assume the methods used by each platform to be comparable as they measure the same features, such as heart rate, HRV, movement etc.
2.  Proportion of sleep spent in REM and deep sleep stages: Time spent in specific stages of sleep, particularly REM and deep sleep, have been found to be essential for high quality sleep. (\textit{Stages of sleep: What happens in a sleep cycle})

Both sleep score and sleep stage proportions impose a notable risk of confounding sleep quality with varying activity tracker platforms and personal sleep habits.

1.  Different platforms may calculate the same sleep conditions with different scores.
2.  Individuals have varying schedules and sleep duration requirements. In addition, different sleep durations naturally affect sleep stage proportions. Deep sleep dominates earlier sleep, while REM dominates later. (\textit{How much deep, light and REM sleep do you need?})

We address this with a paired test, where each subject experiences both control and treatment phases. This allows us to increase power by controlling specifically for activity tracker platform and individual sleep habits.

## Simulating Power

The significance level is set at 0.05. We consider the possibility that using sunglasses may also potentially harm sleep quality, thus we conduct two-tailed t-tests.

We simulate the experiment in different scenarios of true average treatment effect (ATE) and variance. For each scenario, we calculate power at different sample sizes, from 10 to 100 subjects. We run 1,000 simulations at each sample size. Note: Because we are running a paired test, each subject has a control and treatment value; for example, 10 subjects yields 10 control and 10 treatment sleep measurements.

# Sleep Score Scenarios

```{r include=FALSE}
#significance level
alpha = 0.05

# Assumptions
control_avg_score = 75

# vector of sample sizes
sample_sizes = seq(10, 100, by = 10)
```

Assumptions:

-   The mean non-intervention sleep score is 75 (for scenarios 1-4). The standard deviation of sleep scores per individual is \~7.
    -   These figures are determined by a gathering of 2-3 week sleep scores from friends of the researchers.
    -   This average is also supported by data provided by Garmin (\textit{Garmin Blog}).
-   Sleep scores are roughly normally distributed in the population. It is bound by [0-100].

## Scenario 1 (Base Case) - Measurement: Sleep Score, ATE: 8, SD: 7

This is the base case scenario.

-   Mean non-intervention sleep score mean is 75
-   True ATE = 8, based on a small trial run of our experiment conducted with ourselves.
-   Standard deviation = 7, regardless of intervention

```{r echo=FALSE, include=TRUE}
# Scenario parameters
true_ate = 8
stdev = 7


sample_powers = NA   # Create vector to store power at different sample sizes

for (i in 1:length(sample_sizes)) {
  
  sample_size_p_values = NA # Create vector to store p-values

  for (sim in 1:1000) {
    d <- data.table() # Create empty data table
    
    # Draw from control and treatment population
    # Paired test, treatment effect is added to control
    d[, control:= rnorm(sample_sizes[i], mean = control_avg_score, sd = stdev)]
    d[, treatment:= control + rnorm(sample_sizes[i], mean = true_ate, sd = stdev)]
    # Ensure score is between 0 and 100 inclusive 
    d[, control:= pmin(pmax(control, 0), 100)]
    d[, treatment:= pmin(pmax(treatment, 0), 100)]
    
    # t-test of treatment compared control scores and get p-value
    # Store p-value in vector
    sample_size_p_values[sim] = t.test(d[, treatment], d[, control], conf.level=1-alpha)$p.value
  }
  
  # Calculate power, proportion of p_values below our alpha
  # Store in sample_power vector
  sample_powers[i] = mean(sample_size_p_values < alpha)

}

# Show sample sizes and powers
ate_s1 <- data.table(sample_sizes, sample_powers)
ate_s1
```

In this scenario, we are able to achieve a power of `r ate_s1[sample_sizes == 20, sample_powers]` with a sample size of 20.

## Scenario 2 - Measurement: Sleep Score, ATE: 6, SD: 7

For this scenario, we test a case a more conservative ATE.

-   Mean non-intervention sleep score is 75
-   True ATE = 6
-   Standard deviation = 7, regardless of intervention

```{r echo=FALSE, include=TRUE}
# Scenario parameters
true_ate = 6
stdev = 7

sample_powers = NA   # Create vector to store power at different sample sizes

for (i in 1:length(sample_sizes)) {
  
  sample_size_p_values = NA # Create vector to store p-values

  for (sim in 1:1000) {
    d <- data.table() # Create empty data table
    
    # Draw from control and treatment population
    # Paired test, treatment effect is added to control
    d[, control:= rnorm(sample_sizes[i], mean = control_avg_score, sd = stdev)]
    d[, treatment:= control + rnorm(sample_sizes[i], mean = true_ate, sd = stdev)]
    # Ensure score is between 0 and 100 inclusive 
    d[, control:= pmin(pmax(control, 0), 100)]
    d[, treatment:= pmin(pmax(treatment, 0), 100)]    
    
    # t-test of treatment compared control scores and get p-value
    # Store p-value in vector
    sample_size_p_values[sim] = t.test(d[, treatment], d[, control], conf.level=1-alpha)$p.value
  }
  
  # Calculate power, proportion of p_values below our alpha
  # Store in sample_power vector
  sample_powers[i] = mean(sample_size_p_values < alpha)

}

# Show sample sizes and powers
ate_s2 <- data.table(sample_sizes, sample_powers)
ate_s2
```

In this scenario, we are able to achieve a power of `r ate_s2[sample_sizes == 30, sample_powers]` with a sample size of 30.

## Scenario 3 - Measurement: Sleep Score, ATE: 4, SD: 7

For this scenario, we test an even more conservative ATE, half the base case.

-   Mean non-intervention sleep score is 75
-   True ATE = 4
-   Standard deviation = 7, regardless of intervention

```{r echo=FALSE, include=TRUE}
# Scenario parameters
true_ate = 4
stdev = 7

sample_powers = NA   # Create vector to store power at different sample sizes

for (i in 1:length(sample_sizes)) {
  
  sample_size_p_values = NA # Create vector to store p-values

  for (sim in 1:1000) {
    d <- data.table() # Create empty data table
    
    # Draw from control and treatment population
    # Paired test, treatment effect is added to control
    d[, control:= rnorm(sample_sizes[i], mean = control_avg_score, sd = stdev)]
    d[, treatment:= control + rnorm(sample_sizes[i], mean = true_ate, sd = stdev)]
    # Ensure score is between 0 and 100 inclusive 
    d[, control:= pmin(pmax(control, 0), 100)]
    d[, treatment:= pmin(pmax(treatment, 0), 100)]    
    
    # t-test of treatment compared control scores and get p-value
    # Store p-value in vector
    sample_size_p_values[sim] = t.test(d[, treatment], d[, control], conf.level=1-alpha)$p.value
  }
  
  # Calculate power, proportion of p_values below our alpha
  # Store in sample_power vector
  sample_powers[i] = mean(sample_size_p_values < alpha)

}

# Show sample sizes and powers
ate_s3 <- data.table(sample_sizes, sample_powers)
ate_s3
```

In this scenario, we are able to achieve a power of `r ate_s3[sample_sizes == 60, sample_powers]` with a sample size of 60.

## Scenario 4 - Measurement: Sleep Score, ATE: 4, SD: 5

For this scenario, we take the previous scenario of lower ATE but assume a more forgiving variance, which potentially can be realized by not including weekend measurements, where sleep scores were consistently worse in trial data.

-   Mean non-intervention sleep score is 75
-   True ATE = 4
-   Standard deviation = 5, regardless of intervention

```{r echo=FALSE, include=TRUE}
# Scenario parameters
true_ate = 4
stdev = 5

sample_powers = NA   # Create vector to store power at different sample sizes

for (i in 1:length(sample_sizes)) {
  
  sample_size_p_values = NA # Create vector to store p-values

  for (sim in 1:1000) {
    d <- data.table() # Create empty data table
    
    # Draw from control and treatment population
    # Paired test, treatment effect is added to control
    d[, control:= rnorm(sample_sizes[i], mean = control_avg_score, sd = stdev)]
    d[, treatment:= control + rnorm(sample_sizes[i], mean = true_ate, sd = stdev)]
    # Ensure score is between 0 and 100 inclusive 
    d[, control:= pmin(pmax(control, 0), 100)]
    d[, treatment:= pmin(pmax(treatment, 0), 100)]    
    
    # t-test of treatment compared control scores and get p-value
    # Store p-value in vector
    sample_size_p_values[sim] = t.test(d[, treatment], d[, control], conf.level=1-alpha)$p.value
  }
  
  # Calculate power, proportion of p_values below our alpha
  # Store in sample_power vector
  sample_powers[i] = mean(sample_size_p_values < alpha)

}

# Show sample sizes and powers
ate_s4 <- data.table(sample_sizes, sample_powers)
ate_s4
```

In this scenario, we are able to achieve a power of `r ate_s4[sample_sizes == 30, sample_powers]` with a sample size of 30.

# Deep & Rem Sleep Proportion Scenarios

## Scenario 5: Measurement: Deep & REM sleep

We are interested in potentially looking at other sleep metrics as measurement of our outcome of sleep quality. We know that sleep quality, and not just duration, particularly the amount of time spent in the deep and REM phases of sleep can be strong indicators of sleep quality (\textit{Suni, E.}). We attempted to used the effect size calculated by Hedges' g in the study by \textit{Chinoy, E, et al.} in which they compared several different consumer sleep tracking devices to the laboratory standard of polysomnography.

For this scenario we use values from the \textit{Chinoy, E, et al.} study

```{r include=FALSE}
# Define the mean and standard deviation of deep sleep and total sleep time
mean_deep_sleep <- 69.4
sd_deep_sleep <- 27.3
mean_total_sleep <- 456.8
sd_total_sleep <- 21.0

# Calculate the percentage of deep sleep relative to total sleep time
# Deep sleep percentage = (Deep sleep / Total sleep) * 100
deep_sleep_percentage <- (mean_deep_sleep / mean_total_sleep) * 100

# Use the formula for propagating errors to calculate the standard deviation of the percentage
# Reference: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propagation_of_uncertainty#Example_formulas
sd_deep_sleep_percentage <- deep_sleep_percentage * sqrt((sd_deep_sleep/mean_deep_sleep)^2 + (sd_total_sleep/mean_total_sleep)^2)

true_ate_deep = 0.185/ 456.8 * 100

# Print the result
cat("Average deep sleep as a percentage of total sleep time:", round(deep_sleep_percentage, 2), "%\n")
cat("Standard deviation of deep sleep percentage:", round(sd_deep_sleep_percentage, 2), "%\n")
```

```{r include=FALSE}
# Define the mean and standard deviation of deep sleep and total sleep time
mean_rem_sleep <- 120
sd_rem_sleep <- 37.8
mean_total_sleep <- 456.8
sd_total_sleep <- 21.0

# Calculate the percentage of deep sleep relative to total sleep time
# Deep sleep percentage = (Deep sleep / Total sleep) * 100
rem_sleep_percentage <- (mean_rem_sleep / mean_total_sleep) * 100

# Use the formula for propagating errors to calculate the standard deviation of the percentage
# Reference: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propagation_of_uncertainty#Example_formulas
sd_rem_sleep_percentage <- rem_sleep_percentage * sqrt((sd_rem_sleep/mean_rem_sleep)^2 + (sd_total_sleep/mean_total_sleep)^2)

true_ate_rem = 0.25/ 456.8 * 100

# Print the result
cat("Average REM sleep as a percentage of total sleep time:", round(rem_sleep_percentage, 2), "%\n")
cat("Standard deviation of REM sleep percentage:", round(sd_rem_sleep_percentage, 2), "%\n")

```

-   The average non-intervention deep sleep phase as a percentage of total sleep is approximately `r round(deep_sleep_percentage, 2)`%.
-   The average non-intervention REM sleep phase as a percentage of total sleep is approximately `r round(rem_sleep_percentage, 2)`%.
-   The true ATE of deep sleep is 0.185 (minutes) or `r round(true_ate_deep, 2)`%.
-   The true ATE of REM sleep is 0.25 (minutes) or `r round(true_ate_rem, 2)`%..
-   Standard deviation of deep sleep = `r round(sd_deep_sleep_percentage, 2)`%, regardless of intervention.
-   Standard deviation of REM sleep = `r round(sd_rem_sleep_percentage, 2)`%, regardless of intervention.

```

We had some difficulty in interpreting the units of the Hedges' g effect size and how it factors into our power calculation. From these power results, we can see we have extremely low statistical power. We also looked at the deep & REM phases of our self-conducted trial study and found that the difference in means between treatment and control for time spent in deep & REM phases of sleep was also extremely small (not even one-tenth of a percentage point). It is therefore unlikely we can feasibly use these metrics for our outcome.

## Scenario 6 - Deep & REM sleep meaningful ATEs

```{r}
true_ate_deep = 5 
true_ate_rem = 7
```

In order to achieve power of around 60%-80% with 20 to 30 people we would need the true ATE for each one of these to be:

-   $ATE_{deep}$ = `r round(true_ate_deep, 2)`%.
-   $ATE_{REM}$ = `r round(true_ate_rem, 2)`%..

```{r echo=FALSE, include=TRUE}
# Scenario parameters
control_avg_score = deep_sleep_percentage
stdev = sd_deep_sleep_percentage

sample_powers = NA   # Create vector to store power at different sample sizes

for (i in 1:length(sample_sizes)) {
  
  sample_size_p_values = NA # Create vector to store p-values

  for (sim in 1:1000) {
    d <- data.table() # Create empty data table
    
    # Draw from control and treatment population
    # Paired test, treatment effect is added to control
    d[, control:= rnorm(sample_sizes[i], mean = control_avg_score, sd = stdev)]
    d[, treatment:= control + rnorm(sample_sizes[i], mean = true_ate_deep, sd = stdev)]
    # Ensure score is between 0 and 100 inclusive 
    d[, control:= pmin(pmax(control, 0), 100)]
    d[, treatment:= pmin(pmax(treatment, 0), 100)]    
    
    # t-test of treatment compared control scores and get p-value
    # Store p-value in vector
    sample_size_p_values[sim] = t.test(d[, treatment], d[, control], conf.level=1-alpha)$p.value
  }
  
  # Calculate power, proportion of p_values below our alpha
  # Store in sample_power vector
  sample_powers[i] = mean(sample_size_p_values < alpha)

}

# Show sample sizes and powers
ate_deep_o <- data.table(sample_sizes, sample_powers)
ate_deep_o
```

```{r echo=FALSE, include=TRUE}
# Scenario parameters
control_avg_score = rem_sleep_percentage
stdev = sd_rem_sleep_percentage

sample_powers = NA   # Create vector to store power at different sample sizes

for (i in 1:length(sample_sizes)) {
  
  sample_size_p_values = NA # Create vector to store p-values

  for (sim in 1:1000) {
    d <- data.table() # Create empty data table
    
    # Draw from control and treatment population
    # Paired test, treatment effect is added to control
    d[, control:= rnorm(sample_sizes[i], mean = control_avg_score, sd = stdev)]
    d[, treatment:= control + rnorm(sample_sizes[i], mean = true_ate_rem, sd = stdev)]
    # Ensure score is between 0 and 100 inclusive 
    d[, control:= pmin(pmax(control, 0), 100)]
    d[, treatment:= pmin(pmax(treatment, 0), 100)]    
    
    # t-test of treatment compared control scores and get p-value
    # Store p-value in vector
    sample_size_p_values[sim] = t.test(d[, treatment], d[, control], conf.level=1-alpha)$p.value
  }
  
  # Calculate power, proportion of p_values below our alpha
  # Store in sample_power vector
  sample_powers[i] = mean(sample_size_p_values < alpha)

}

# Show sample sizes and powers
ate_rem_o <- data.table(sample_sizes, sample_powers)
ate_rem_o
```

We reach a power of .8 around 26-27 subjects.
